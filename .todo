1. Fix Current Issues (Priority 1)

Replace all alert() calls with simple modal dialogs
Add basic input validation with inline error messages
Fix WebSocket memory leaks by properly removing event listeners
Add basic error handling for network failures

2. Reduce Code Size - Eliminate Unnecessary Classes
Looking at your current classes, you can significantly simplify:
Remove These Heavy Singletons:
typescript// DELETE: These are over-engineered
- AuthManager (100+ lines) → Simple auth functions
- MenuFlowManager (200+ lines) → Simple menu functions  
- AppStateManager → Just use simple state variables
- HistoryManager → Use browser history API directly
- KeyboardManager → Simple event listeners
Replace with Simple Functions:
typescript// auth.ts - Simple functions instead of AuthManager class
let currentUser = null;
let isLoggedIn = false;

export function login(username: string, password: string) {
  // Simple login logic
}

export function logout() {
  currentUser = null;
  isLoggedIn = false;
  updateUI();
}

export function getCurrentUser() {
  return currentUser;
}
Keep Only Essential Classes:
typescript// KEEP these - they manage complex state
- WebSocketClient (networking is complex)
- GameController (game lifecycle is complex)
- UIManager (but simplify it)
3. Simplify Architecture
Replace Manager Pattern with Simple Modules:
typescript// Instead of class AuthManager
// Use: auth.ts with simple functions

// Instead of class MenuFlowManager  
// Use: menu.ts with simple functions

// Instead of class AppStateManager
// Use: gameState.ts with simple variables
Simple State Management:
typescript// gameState.ts - Replace AppStateManager
export let gameState = {
  isPlaying: false,
  isPaused: false,
  currentMode: null,
  players: []
};

export function setGameState(newState) {
  gameState = { ...gameState, ...newState };
}
4. Meet School Requirements
Complete Tournament System:

Implement proper bracket generation
Add matchmaking logic
Show tournament progression

Add Missing Security:

HTTPS/WSS support
Input validation on all forms
Password hashing when you add database

Fix Navigation:

Proper browser back/forward support
Clean URL routing

5. Practical Steps to Reduce Code:

Start with auth.ts - Replace AuthManager with simple functions
Simplify menu.ts - Replace MenuFlowManager with basic event handlers
Remove unnecessary abstractions - Direct DOM manipulation instead of complex UI patterns
Consolidate similar functions - You have duplicate code across managers
Use native APIs - Replace custom implementations with browser APIs

6. Target Code Reduction:
Current: ~15 complex classes, 3000+ lines
Target:  ~5 essential classes, 1500-2000 lines
The goal: Make your code more maintainable and meet school requirements without over-engineering. Focus on functionality over perfect architecture.
Start with: Pick one manager class and convert it to simple functions. You'll immediately see how much simpler the code becomes.
Which class would you like to tackle first? I'd recommend starting with AuthManager since it's relatively straightforward.

Option 1: Squash Merge (Recommended)
This creates just ONE clean commit on main:
bash# Make all your changes on your branch
git add .
git commit -m "Refactor: Replace AuthManager with simple functions"
git commit -m "Simplify HistoryManager"
git commit -m "Remove MenuFlowManager singleton"
# ... etc

# Then when ready to merge to main:
git checkout main
git merge --squash your-branch-name
git commit -m "Refactor: Simplify frontend architecture by removing heavy singleton
